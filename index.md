## How to buy Ripple (XRP)

#### Buy directly

**[CEX.io](https://cex.io/r/0/up109972798/0/)**

CEX is an exchange, you can buy all sorts of crypto online, the best part about it is that the verification process to buy small amounts with **Credit Cards** is very simple. 

**[Changelly](https://changelly.com/?ref_id=24b764cfb79d)**

Changelly is an instant exchange, instead of lining up orders like a traditional exchange, they provide exchange rates for crypto-to-crypto transactions.

#### Jump through hoops

You can still get XRP through your traditional exchange, you just have to perform some additional steps.

**Scenario #1 - Through [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/59f740cda24eb102f4b6b060)**

- Buy LiteCoin or Ethereum on [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/59f740cda24eb102f4b6b060) (avoid Bitcoin) with a Credit Card
- Send it to your current exchange
- Trade it for XRP

## Where to Store Ripple (XRP)

#### Hardware Wallet

The best option is to purchase a hardware wallet and store your coins in your own pocket :). Right now the best option is you can find is the [Ledger Nano S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J66NF46/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01J66NF46&linkCode=as2&tag=tradexrpco-20&linkId=002025bef7f03c063abd305747b1c78f).

#### Exchanges

You can store ripple directly on the exchange where you have bought it. The problem with this scenario is that exchanges can be very fragile, it can be hard to withdraw your funds when there is high demands or they can disappear altogether (remember [Mt. Gox]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)?)

#### Software Wallet

These are basically free, you just download the software and follow a few simple steps. The problem here is that if your PC is compromised (virus or hacked), then you risk losing all your coins.
