### Where to Store Ripple (XRP)

**Exchanges**
You can store ripple directly on the exchange where you have bought it. The problem with this scenario is that exchanges can be very fragile, it can be hard to withdraw your funds when there is high demands or they can disappear altogether (remember [Mt. Gox]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)?)

**Hardware Wallet**
The best option is to purchase a hardware wallet and store your coins in your own pocket :).

**Software Wallet**
These are basically free, you just download the software and follow a few simple steps. The problem here is that if your PC is compromised (virus or hacked), then you risk losing all your coins.
